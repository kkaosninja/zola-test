This is a test blog to figure out how to deploy a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) blog with [Abridge theme](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge) to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

Also hope to get a [Mozilla Observatory score of A+](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/abridge.netlify.app) similar to the [Abridge example blog deployed to Netlify](https://abridge.netlify.app/)
